- 👋 Hello there, I’m @OliverAltaras. I'm a level 8 software development student expecting to graduate in 2021. Currently working in banking, I came over here
to share some of my projects and ideas, and hopefully collaborate with all you fine people who like the same stuff as me. =D
- 👀 I’m interested in several different programming languages, algorithms, tips, challenges, opportunities and other software development things.
Although my main focus is in Java, I have also developed skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL and (a tiny bit) in PHP and shell scripting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning relational database programming, focusing on MySQL and the XAMPP stack. 
I'm also actively seeking a job in software development; so, if you think we're a good match, don't be shy to drop me a message!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the development of interesting applications, as well as get some feedback and learn new stuff from fellow developers.
In exchange, I post around some simple, and some more complex, programs I have developed over the last year or so - I hope you'll find them useful.
- 📫 Drop me a message at any time!
