- 👋 Hello there, I’m @OliverAltaras. I'm a level 8 software development student expecting to graduate in 2021. Currently working in banking, I came over here
to share some of my projects and ideas, and hopefully collaborate with all you fine people who like the same stuff as me! =D
- 👀 I’m interested in several different programming languages, algorithms, tips, opportunities and other software development things.
Although my main focus is in Java, I have also developed skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL and (a tiny bit) in PHP and shell scripting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning relational database programming, focusing on MySQL and the XAMPP stack. 
I'm also actively seeking a job in the area, so don't be shy to drop me a message!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the development of interesting applications, as well as get some feedback and learn new stuff from fellow developer.
Generally, you can use my codes for any project you like - I hope that they are helpful to you!
- 📫 Drop me a message at any time.
